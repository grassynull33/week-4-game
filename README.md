## Technologies Used
- jQuery for DOM manipulation
- HTML/CSS

## Code Explanation
- Characters and their property-value pairs stored as JavaScript objects
- Character elements are dynamically created based off of variables and data in the JavaScript file
- Based on user input (mouse clicks), character elements are given certain classes
- Classes dictate behavior, placement, and styling, so they (along with their corresponding CSS) are the basis of the game's experience and look
- jQuery simplifies the process of selecting and modifying DOM elements
